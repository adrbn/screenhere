# The build signs the executable it produces, but not the code *inside* a
# binary package dependency. Sparkle ships a helper app, a bare Autoupdate
# binary and (in some versions) XPC services that keep the signature they were
# published with. Two things break if they stay that way:
#
#   - Apple rejects the whole archive at notarization ("not signed with a valid
#     Developer ID certificate", "does not include a secure timestamp");
#   - Sparkle refuses to launch its own installer when Autoupdate is not signed
#     with the same identity as the app, which the user sees as the useless
#     "An error occurred while launching the installer."
#
# It lives in its own script rather than inside the release because install.sh
# needs it just as much, and an invariant enforced in only one of two places is
# the bug it is meant to prevent.
