# (TCC) grant to the app's code identity. An ad-hoc signature has no stable
# identity — its designated requirement is the cdhash, which changes on every
# build, so the user must re-authorise the app after each update. Worse, the
# Settings toggle keeps *looking* enabled while tccd quietly denies every
# capture. A Developer ID signature pins the requirement to the team, and the
